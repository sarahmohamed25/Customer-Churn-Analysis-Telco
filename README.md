# Customer-Churn-Analysis-Telco
This project explores retail sales data to uncover trends and forecast future performance using time series analysis.

Customer churn prediction and analysis project using Python, Machine Learning, and Visualization tools.

## 📊 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing and predicting customer churn in the telecom industry using a real-world dataset. The goal is to uncover key factors driving churn and build models to predict whether a customer is likely to leave.

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies Used

- **Python**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
- **Machine Learning**: Logistic Regression, Random Forest
- **Visualization**: Correlation heatmaps, pie charts, bar plots
- **IDE**: Jupyter Notebook
- **Version Control**: Git & GitHub

---

## 🧠 Key Objectives

- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing
- Explore data patterns and customer behavior
- Visualize churn distribution and key influencing features
- Build ML classification models to predict churn
- Evaluate model performance using confusion matrix & accuracy score
- Deliver insights with business recommendations

---

## 📈 Results

- **Logistic Regression Accuracy**: 81.76%
- **Random Forest Accuracy**: 79.77%
- **Top Churn Factors**: Monthly Charges, Tenure, Total Charges, Contract Type

## 📌 Visual Highlights

- **Churn Distribution Pie Chart**
- **Correlation Heatmap**
- **Feature Importance via Random Forest**
- **Churn breakdowns by Contract, Payment Method, Partner, etc.**
- **Confusion Matrices for both models**

---

## ✅ Insights & Takeaways

- Customers with **month-to-month contracts** and **high monthly charges** are most likely to churn.
- Long-tenured customers and those on **annual contracts** tend to stay longer.
- Predictive models can help telecom companies proactively engage at-risk customers.
