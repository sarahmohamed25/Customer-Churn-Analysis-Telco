# 📞 Customer Churn Analysis – Telecom Industry
This project explores customer behavior in the telecom industry to identify churn drivers and build predictive models that help businesses proactively retain at-risk customers.

## 📂 Project Highlights
📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
-Churn distribution and breakdown by demographics & services
-Correlation analysis of churn factors
-Feature importance using Random Forest
🤖 Machine Learning Modeling
-Logistic Regression and Random Forest models
-Confusion matrices to evaluate model accuracy
-Achieved up to 81.76% accuracy with Logistic Regression

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies Used
- **Python**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
- **Machine Learning**: Logistic Regression, Random Forest
- **Visualization**: Correlation heatmaps, pie charts, bar plots
- **IDE**: Jupyter Notebook
- **Version Control**: Git & GitHub

---

## 📈 Results

- **Logistic Regression Accuracy**: 81.76%
- **Random Forest Accuracy**: 79.77%
- **Top Churn Factors**: Monthly Charges, Tenure, Total Charges, Contract Type

---

## ✅ Insights & Takeaways
- 26.5% of customers churned in the dataset
- Features like Monthly Charges, Contract Type, and Tenure had the strongest correlation with churn
- Customers with **month-to-month contracts** and **high monthly charges** are most likely to churn.
- Long-tenured customers and those on **annual contracts** tend to stay longer.
- Predictive models can help telecom companies proactively engage at-risk customers.

---

## 💡 Business Recommendations
- Promote long-term contracts to reduce churn
- Target customers with high monthly charges and short tenure
- Enhance value-added services like Online Security and Tech Support
- Promote more stable payment methods (e.g., bank auto-pay)
- Use ML models to identify and retain at-risk customers proactively
